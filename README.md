> Dead simple tooting with your favourite editor, from / using your shell

This is a fork of [jn](https://github.com/CosineP/jn) for tooting. It's no
tootstream and it's not meant to be.

Installation
------------

1. Clone it
2. Add it to your path
3. Install python3
4. `pip3 install mastodon.py`
5. `cp dummy-secureconfig.py secureconfig.py`
6. Edit secureconfig.py to have your correct uname and password

Usage
-----

    $ fd Went to the post office

<!-- I can't believe it, but this is necessary to split these up -->

    $ fd

> Brings up your $EDITOR in insert mode. Saving and quitting toots.
